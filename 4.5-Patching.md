# Patching

For organizations, keeping their systems and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches/updates is critical in ensuring that their systems are not compromised by any security breaches.

In Azure, [OMS Update Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management) allows you to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux computers deployed in Azure, on-premises environments, or other cloud providers. You can quickly assess the status of available updates on all agent computers and manage the process of installing required updates for servers.

The following diagram shows a conceptual view of the behavior and data flow with how the Update Management solution assesses and applies security updates to all connected Windows Server and Linux computers in a OMS workspace:
