# Securing Azure IaaS Workloads

Security requirements can vary for different types of workloads.  When you move to Azure IaaS, you can apply your expertise in securing virtual environments and use a new set of options to help secure your assets. 


## Guidance 
- Implement [Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations) that is protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors to complete sensitive tasks.  

- Use [Multi-Factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication) to safeguard access to data and applications while meeting user demand for a simple sign-in process.  
- [Limit and constrain administrative access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#limit-and-constrain-administrative-access) to ensure that you secure the accounts that manage your IaaS workloads. For example, you can use [Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) to manage, monitor, and control access in your organization. It helps you remain aware of the actions that individuals take in your organization. It also brings just-in-time administration to Azure AD by introducing the concept of eligible admins.  
- Use [DevTest labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-lab/devtest-lab-overview) for testing and development purposes because it uses [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to segregate duties into roles that grant only the level of access necessary for users to do their jobs. RBAC comes with predefined roles (owner, lab user, and contributor).  
- [Control and limit endpoint access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#control-and-limit-endpoint-access) to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. You can use a VPN option (I.e. Site-to-Site) to reconfigure the access control lists on the NSGs to not allow access to management endpoints from the Internet. 
- Use a key management solution such as [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis) to securely store encryption keys and small secrets like passwords in hardware security module (HSM) for your Azure resources. 
- Use a centralized security management system such as [Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/) and [Operations Management Suite Security and Compliance](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/) to monitor your servers for patching, configuration, events, and activities that might be considered security concerns 
- Manage your virtual machines by [security hardening](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#harden-systems) the operating systems, [installing anti-malware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-antimalware) and [installing the latest security updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#install-the-latest-security-updates)
