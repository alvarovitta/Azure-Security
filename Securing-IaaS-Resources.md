In most infrastructure as a service (IaaS) scenarios, Azure virtual machines (VMs) are the main workload for organizations that use cloud computing.  

With Azure, you can build security-enhanced, compliant solutions that: 

- Protect your virtual machines from viruses and malware 

- Encrypt your sensitive data 

- Secure network traffic between your virtual machines 

- Identify and detect threats 

- Meet compliance requirements 



## Guidance 

- Protect your virtual machines by implementing authentication and access controls to ensure that only authorized users are able to provision and access your virtual machines 

- Implement multiple virtual machines for high availability for mission critical applications and implement availability sets. 

- Control the network traffic flow between your virtual machines and the internet by implementing network security groups 

- Protect at rest in your virtual machines by enforcing data encryption  

- Ensure that you manage updates and monthly patching of your virtual machines 

- Implement Azure Security Center to safeguard your virtual machines from cyber threats 

- Monitor the performance of your virtual machines to ensure there are no performance issues that can lead to service disruption, which violates the security principle of availability. For this reason, it is imperative to monitor VM access not only reactively, while an issue is occurring, but also proactively, against baseline performance as measured during normal operation. 

- Implement Resource locks across your VMs to prevent unwanted or accidental changes or deletion to a resource.
