# Securing Azure PaaS Resources
Use the information in this section when planning to implement resource security using the Platform as a Service (PaaS) scenario.
<br />
<br />

In PaaS scenarios, [web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview), storage and databases are the main workloads for organizations that use cloud computing. Paas services have a public endpoint; as a result of its usage profile, give careful consideration to secure your workload resources. 

PaaS provides the following three services:  
- Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises.  

- [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview) and [SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is) provide a relational database service for your Internet-based applications.  

- Azure makes it possible to deploy and use storage in ways not easily achievable on-premises. With [Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction), you can reach high levels of scalability and availability with relatively little effort.  
<br />
<br />

## Guidance for App Service 
- [Authenticate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) through Azure Active Directory (AD). App Service provides an OAuth 2.0 service for your identity provider.  

- Restrict access based on need-to-know and least-privilege security principles. [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) can be used to assign permissions to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. 

- Use [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis) to safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services.  

- Use [App Service Environment's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/intro) virtual network integration feature to restrict inbound source IP addresses (through network security groups) and to run Web App in an isolated environment. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance for PaaS Databases 
- Use a centralized identity repository for [authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#use-a-centralized-identity-repository-for-authentication-and-authorization)


- [Restrict Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#restrict-access-based-on-ip-address) based on IP address 


- Encryption of [data at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#encryption-of-data-at-rest)
<br />
<br />

## Guidance for Azure Storage 
- Use [Shared Access Signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) instead of a storage account key as it allows you to share content the way you want to share it without giving away your Storage Account Keys.  

- Use [managed disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview) for VMs and let Azure manage the storage accounts that you use for VM disks. 

- Use [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#use-role-based-access-control), With RBAC, you focus on giving employees the exact permissions they need, based on the need to know and least privilege security principles. 

- Use [client-side encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#use-client-side-encryption-for-high-value-data) for high value data, it enables you to programmatically encrypt data in transit before uploading to Azure Storage and programmatically decrypt data when retrieving it from storage. 

- Use [Azure Disk Encryption for VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#azure-disk-encryption-for-vms), it helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine disks.  

- Enable [Storage Service Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#storage-service-encryption) to automatically encrypt data.
