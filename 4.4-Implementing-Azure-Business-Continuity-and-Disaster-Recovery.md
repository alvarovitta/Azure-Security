# Implementing Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Use the information and procedure described in this section to plan and implement a strategy to minimize the impact of a outage on your system resources. The strategy is designed to preserve, protect and recover data and resume operations in the shortest span of time. 
<br />
<br />

Organizations need to adopt a business continunity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that keeps your data safe and your applications and workloads up and running. The BCDR is applicable to planned and unplanned outages.

Site Recovery is an Azure service that contributes to your BCDR strategy and provides the following:
- keeps business applications and workloads running during outages
- Workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) are mirrored to a secondary site. Should an outage occur at the primary site, operations fail-over to the secondary site. After the primary site recovers, workloads are transferred from the secondary site to the primary. The primary site resumes normal operations.

Site Recovery helps you to:
  - manage Azure VMs replicating between Azure regions.
  - manage On-premises VMs and physical servers replicating to Azure, or to a secondary site.
  
Site Recovery can also help create disaster recovery solutions by integrating with Microsoft applications as well as 3rd party applications such as:  
- [SharePoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-workload#protect-sharepoint)
- [Exchange](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Exchange-DR-Solution-using-11a7dcb6)
- [Dynamics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-dynamicsax)
- [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sql)
- [Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-workload#replicate-active-directory-and-dns)
- [SAP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sap)
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
- Use [Recovery Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-create-recovery-plans) in Azure Site Recovery to help you create and customize a systematic recovery plan. For example, defining how machines fail over, and the sequence in which they start after failover. You can use recovery plans to do the following:
  - [Model an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#model-apps) around its dependencies.
  - [Automate recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#automate-tasks) tasks to reduce RTO.
  - Verify that you're prepared for migration or disaster recovery by ensuring that your apps are part of a recovery plan.
  - Run [test failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#test-failover) on recovery plans, to ensure disaster recovery or migration is working as expected.

## Preparation
- [Prepare Azure resources for replication of on-premises machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure)
- If you are using VMWare, [Prepare your on-premises VMware servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises)
- If you are using Hyper-V, [Prepare on-premises Hyper-V servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/hyper-v-prepare-on-premises-tutorial)
- Review the [support requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix) for all components.
