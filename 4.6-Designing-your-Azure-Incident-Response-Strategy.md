# Designing your Azure Incident Response Strategy
Use the information provided in this section to help design your response to security-related incidents.
<br />
<br />

To reduce costs and damage, have an incident response plan in place before your organization experiences an attack or security breach. Use Azure Security Center in the different stages of an incident response.

An effective plan depends on three core capabilities: 
1. **Ability to protect**:  Preventing incidents
2. **Detection**:  Identify threats early
3. **Response to threats**:  Evicting the attacker and restoring systems to mitigate the impact of a breach
<br />
<br />

The following diagram illustrates the security incident response stages:

<br />
<br />

Use Security Center during the Detect, Assess, and Diagnose stages.  
The following are examples of how Security Center can be useful during the three initial incident response stages:

- **Detect:** review the first indication of an event investigation.
   *Example: review the initial verification that a high-priority security alert was raised in the Security Center dashboard.*
- **Assess:** perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.
   *Example: obtain more information about the security alert.*
- **Diagnose:** conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies.
   *Example: follow the remediation steps described by Security Center in that particular security alert.*
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following incident response plan to ensure that all the following phases are a part of the plan:

1. Initial assessment.
2. Incident communication.
3. Damage control and risk reduction.
4. Identification of what it was compromise and severity.
5. Evidence preservation.
6. Notification to appropriate parties.
7. System recovery.
8. Documentation.
9. Damage and cost assessment.
10. Process and plan revision.
