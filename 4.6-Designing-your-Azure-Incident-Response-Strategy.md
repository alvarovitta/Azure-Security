# Designing your Azure Incident Response Strategy

Many organizations learn how to respond to security incidents only after suffering an attack. To reduce costs and damage, it’s important to have an incident response plan in place before an attack takes place. You can use Azure Security Center in different stages of an incident response.

An effective plan depends on three core capabilities: being able to protect, detect, and respond to threats. Protection is about preventing incidents, detection is about identifying threats early, and response is about evicting the attacker and restoring systems to mitigate the impacts of a breach.

The following diagram illustrates the security incident response stages:

You can use Security Center during the Detect, Assess, and Diagnose stages. Here are examples of how Security Center can be useful during the three initial incident response stages:

- **Detect:** review the first indication of an event investigation.
    - *Example: review the initial verification that a high-priority security alert was raised in the Security Center dashboard.*
- **Assess:** perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.
    - *Example: obtain more information about the security alert.*
- **Diagnose:** conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies.
    - *Example: follow the remediation steps described by Security Center in that particular security alert.*

## Guidance
Use the following incident response plan to ensure that all the following phases are a part of the plan:

1. Initial assessment.
2. Incident communication.
3. Damage control and risk reduction.
4. Identification of what it was compromise and severity.
5. Evidence preservation.
6. Notification to appropriate parties.
7. System recovery.
8. Documentation.
9. Damage and cost assessment.
10. Process and plan revision.
