# Securing PaaS Resources
In Platform as a service (PaaS) scenarios, [web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview), storage and databases are the main workloads for organizations that use cloud computing. By nature Paas services have public endpoint, we need to be careful on their security. 
 
- Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises.  


- [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview) and [SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is) provide a relational database service for your Internet-based applications.  


- Azure makes it possible to deploy and use storage in ways not easily achievable on-premises. With [Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction), you can reach high levels of scalability and availability with relatively little effort.  



 


## Guidance for App Service 

- [Authenticate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) through Azure Active Directory (AD), App Service provides an OAuth 2.0 service for your identity provider.  

- Restrict access based on the need to know and least privilege security principles. [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) can be used to assign permissions to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. 

- Use [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis) to safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. .  

- Use [App Service Environment's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/intro)  virtual network integration feature to restrict incoming source IP addresses through network security groups (NSGs) and run Web App in isolated environment. 


## Guidance for PaaS Databases 

- Use a centralized identity repository for [authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#use-a-centralized-identity-repository-for-authentication-and-authorization)


- [Restrict Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#restrict-access-based-on-ip-address) based on IP Address 


- Encryption of [data at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-sql#encryption-of-data-at-rest)



## Guidance for Azure Storage 

- Use [Shared Access Signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) instead of a storage account key as it allows you to share content the way you want to share it without giving away your Storage Account Keys.  

- Use [managed disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview) for VMs and let Azure manage the storage accounts that you use for VM disks. 


- Use [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#use-role-based-access-control), With RBAC, you focus on giving employees the exact permissions they need, based on the need to know and least privilege security principles. 


- Use [client-side encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#use-client-side-encryption-for-high-value-data) for high value data, it enables you to programmatically encrypt data in transit before uploading to Azure Storage and programmatically decrypt data when retrieving it from storage. 


- Use [Azure Disk Encryption for VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#azure-disk-encryption-for-vms), it helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine disks.  


- Enable [Storage Service Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-paas-applications-using-storage#storage-service-encryption) to automatically encrypt data.
