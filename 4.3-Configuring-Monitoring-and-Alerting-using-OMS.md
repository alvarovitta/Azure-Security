# Configuring Monitoring and Alerting using OMS
Use the information and procedure described in this section to configure Azure activity log analytics using Operation Management Suite (OMS).
<br />
<br />

OMS provides an analysis and reporting function so that you can monitor the performance and security health of your system. You will recieve logs and alerts on system events related to the resources that host your systems. These are system-generated notifications provided in real-time. 

Use a proactive approach when employing security monitoring. Audit your resources to identify systems that do not meet organizational standards or best practices.

OMS provides:
- OMS Log Analytics
- OMS Security and Compliance Solution
- OMS Network Performance Monitor (NPM)
<br />
<br />

Use the following security tools/features to monitor and audit your network: 

 [OMS Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json):  
 Use this feature to obtain detailed insights into the activities occuring in your Azure environment.   
 With log analytics you can:  
- use its [query language](https://docs.loganalytics.io/index) to quickly retrieve, consolidate, analyze and create [security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts) based on data collected from Azure resources across multiple subscriptions.  
     
- identify malware using the [Malware Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-malware?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json) 
- monitor your networks using the [Azure Application Gateway Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json#azure-application-gateway-analytics-solution-in-log-analytics) solution 
- monitor your network security group by using the [Azure Network Security Group Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json#azure-network-security-group-analytics-solution-in-log-analytics) solution
- use [Activity Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity) to see operational activities aggregated by status, view trends of activities on your Azure resources and even identify outages or service health issues impacting your Azure resources
<br />

[OMS Security and Compliance Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard):  
  IT uses this feature to actively monitor all resources with an objective to minimize the impact of security incidents. OMS Security and Audit has security domains that can be used for monitoring resources. The [Security and Audit Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard) is the home screen for everything related to security in OMS. It provides high-level insight into the security state of your computers. It also includes the ability to view all events from the past 24 hours, 7 days, or any other custom time frame.
<br />

[OMS Network Performance Monitor (NPM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor):  
  is a suite of capabilities, each of which is geared towards monitoring the health of your network, network connectivity to your applications, and provides insights into the performance of your network. Monitoring capabilities include: [Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-performance-monitor), [ExpressRoute Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-expressroute) and [Service Endpoint Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-service-endpoint). NPM is cloud-based and provides a hybrid network monitoring solution that monitors connectivity between:
     - Cloud deployments and on-premises locations
     - Multiple data centers and branch offices
     - Mission critical multi-tier applications/micro-services
     - User locations and web-based applications (HTTP/HTTPs)
<br />
<br />

## Guidance

- [Enable Diagnostic Logging to Stream logs to Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-diagnostic-logs-log-analytics) for detailed analysis 
 - Understand Log Searches in Log Analytics. For example, [where log searches are used](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-log-search#where-log-searches-are-used), [how data is organized](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-log-search#how-log-analytics-data-is-organized), [how to write a query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-log-search#writing-a-query). 
 - When creating monitoring rules, disable the default rule and create custom monitoring rules. This is especially appropriate on large networks that use a large number of nodes for monitoring. Custom monitoring rules can reduce the traffic generated by the solution and help organize the monitoring of the network. 
 - When configuring Network Performance Monitor, create a network that groups subnets. Use this grouping method instead of the default setting (creates the default network and all of the subnets in your environment). 
 - When choosing a protocol, use TCP for monitoring. Use ICMP in scenarios where you can't use TCP, such as:  
    - You use Windows client-based nodes, because TCP raw sockets aren't allowed in Windows clients 
    - Your network firewall or NSG blocks TCP 
    - You don't know how to switch the protocol 
<br />

## Preparation 

Perform the following prior to using the procedure in this section:   

  - Ensure you have an Azure subscription and an Office 365 subscription  
  - Ensure that you are the subscription owner of both Azure and Office 365 
  - Ensure [diagnostic logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-azure-diagnostic-logs#enable-logging-with-azure-portal) is enabled for your Azure resources
<br />
