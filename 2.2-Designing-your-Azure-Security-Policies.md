# Designing your Azure Security Policies
Use the procedure described this section to follow supplemental design and guidance on how implement Azure security policies. 
<br />
<br />


**Design considerations**: 
- Keep organizational hierarchies in mind when creating definitions and assignments.  
 
- To apply policies across subscriptions, you must have permissions across the subscriptions. 
- Plan how to manage policy exceptions 
<br />
<br />


## Guidance 
- Create policy definitions at a higher level such as the management group or subscription level, and assigning at the next child level. For example, if you create a policy definition at the management group level, a policy assignment of that definition can be scoped down to a subscription level within that management group.  
 
- Start with using an audit effect vs a deny effect when creating policy definitions in your environment. This technique will help you track the effects of your policy definition on the resources in your environment.  
 
- If you have scripts already in place to auto scale up your applications, setting a deny effect may hinder those automation tasks you already have in place.   
 
- Use initiative definitions instead of policy definitions even for single policies. This technique helps with tracking.  
 
- Apply policies that map to organizational compliance, operational and security requirements. 
 
- Develop a process that justifies and manages exceptions to policies. 
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Use the following tables to collect policy information so that you can create policies and definitions: 

**Policy/Initiative definition**: 

  | __Field__ | __Value__ |
  |-------------|------------|
  | Resource Policy or Initiative Name  | Policy or Initiative Name     | 
  | Resource Policies*     | Set of Policies Included | 
  | Description       | Type of Policy or Definition | 
  | [Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#mode)         | All or Indexed | 
  | [Policy Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#parameters)         | i.e. AllowedLocation   | 
  | [Policy Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#policy-rule)        | If or Then | 
  | Effect       | i.e. Audit, Deny, Append, AuditIfNotExists, DeployIfNotExists, DenyIfNotExists | 

*In the case of initiatives 
<br />
<br />

**Policy/Initiative assignment**: 

  | __Field__ | __Value__ |
  |-------------|------------|
  | Name  | Assignment Name    | 
  | Policy Definition     | Policy Definition (see above) | 
  | Scope     | i.e. Subscription, Resource group, Resource | 
  | Exclude Scope     | i.e. Resource Group | 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to Create and Assign a Resource Policy 
Use this procedure to create and manage policies to enforce compliance. The Subscription Owner uses Azure Portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. Refer to [Top 10 Baseline Azure Security Policies](Top-10-Baseline-Azure-Security-Policies.md)  for recommended patterns 

1. Sign into the Azure portal and Login as the Subscription Owner, see:  [Azure Portal](http://azure.portal.com/)

 
2. Create a policy to enforce compliance. Define the policy in terms of rules, scope, exceptions, and effect. 


3. Refer to the following: 

- [Assign a policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/create-manage-policy#assign-a-policy) 
- [Implement a new custom policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/create-manage-policy#implement-a-new-custom-policy) 
- [Create a policy definition with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/create-manage-policy#create-a-policy-definition-with-powershell) 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to Create and Assign an Initiative Policy Definition  
Use this procedure to manage policies at scale, leverage initiatives. The Subscription Owner uses Azure Portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.  

1. Sign into the Azure portal and Login as the Subscription Owner, see:  [Azure Portal](http://azure.portal.com/)

2. Create a policy to enforce compliance. Define the policy rules, scope, exceptions, and effect. 

3. Refer to the following: 

  [Initiative Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/azure-policy-introduction#initiative-assignment)
