# Evaluating your On-Premises Security Policies 

Use the information in section to evaluate the on-premesis security policies needed to secure your organization's systems, applications and network.

A security policy comprises of objectives for your organization, rules for your end users and administrators to adhere by and requirements for systems and applications to follow to ensure the security foundation of your organization. 

**Suggestion:**  
*Consider the following when building your organization's security policy:*
- *objectives (what kind of objectives - to do what?)*
- *systems and applications infrastructure that support the objectives*
- *rules for your end-users and administrators that govern and support the security fundamentals as defined by the objectives and system infrastructure*
