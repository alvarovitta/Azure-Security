# Evaluating your On-Premises Security Policies 

Use the information in section to evaluate the on-premesis security policies needed to secure your organization's systems, applications and network.

A security policy comprises of objectives for your organization, rules for your end users and administrators to adhere by and requirements for systems and applications to follow to ensure the security foundation of your organization. 

**Suggestion:**  
A security policy encompasses the following:
- system and application requirements definitions to build the security foundation of your organization 
- objectives that your organization wishes to achieve once the requirements are defined
- rules for your end-users and administrators to follow which satisfy the requirements and objectives
<br />


## Preparation 
**New:** Use the questions listed below to analyze your requirements. Use the analysis results to plan your design and build the security framework for your cloud infrastructure.


- What are your current security policies around your existing systems and applications? 


- How do end users and customers access your systems and applications? 


- What types of security controls implemented for Identity and Access Management of your user accounts? How are they enforced on your systems/applications?
