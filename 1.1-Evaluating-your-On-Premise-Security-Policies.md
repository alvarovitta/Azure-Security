# Evaluating your On-Premises Security Policies 
Use the information in section to evaluate the on-premesis security policies needed to secure your organization's systems, applications and network.
<br />
<br />

Consider the following when building your organization's security policy:
- objectives (what kind of objectives - to do what?)
- systems and applications infrastructure that support the objectives
- rules for your end-users and administrators that govern and support the security fundamentals as defined by the objectives and system infrastructure
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
Analyze your requirements and plan your security framework accordingly. Use the questions listed below together with feedback from your lines of business (LOB) as the basis of your analysis. Use the analysis results to plan your design and build the security framework for your cloud infrastructure.

- What do you require to support security for your systems and/or business applications?

- Will any system or application house sensitive or proprietary data? 

- What controls are required to ensure data security?

- What do you require to provide for and support controlled, secure access for your applications?

- How do you monitor the security events of your existing systems and/or applications? What are the security tools in place to monitor such events?
<br />

**Access**:
- How do end users and customers access your systems and applications? 
- Do you have security policies around privileged access controls for the applications and systems that house sensitive and proprietary data? 
- What types of security controls are implemented for Identity and Access Management of your user accounts? How are they enforced on your systems/applications? 
<br />

**Governance**:  
- What are your current security policies around your existing systems and applications?
- What are your network security policies? 
<br />

**Data protection**:  
- What are your data protection and retention policies? 
- What are your data classification policies? 
- What are your security policies around security updates and patching of your systems and applications? 
- What are you security policies around segregation of customer data? 
<br />
