# Establishing your Security Baseline
Use the procedure described in this section to enable access to the Security Center for your subscription. Use the guidance information in this section to build and configure your security policy.

<br />


In Azure Security Center, you can define policies for your Azure subscriptions to ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements an tailor them for your desired configuration of your workloads. Once you define policies for your Azure subscriptions, and adapt them to the type of workload or the sensitivity of your data, Security Center can provide security recommendations to your compute, networking, SQL & storage, and application resources.
