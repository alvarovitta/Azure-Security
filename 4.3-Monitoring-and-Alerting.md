# Monitoring and Alerting

We often think of monitoring as watching and waiting for an event to occur so that we can react to the situation. Security monitoring refers to having a proactive strategy that audits your resources to identify systems that do not meet organizational standards or best practices.

With Azure, there are security tools/features that are available to you to aid you in monitoring, auditing, logging and alerting of any issues to your resources that host your systems. The tool/features available to you are:

 -  [OMS Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json): is a feature under the Operation Management Suite (OMS) that gives you the ability to obtain detailed insights into the activities happening in your Azure environment. With log analytics you can:
     - see operational activities aggregated by status 
     - view trends of activities happening on each of your Azure services 
     - report on authorization changes on all your Azure resources 
     - identify outages or service health issues impacting your resources 
     - use its [query language](https://docs.loganalytics.io/index) to quickly retrieve, consolidate, analyze and create [security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts) from collected data from Azure resources across multiple subscriptions. 
     - you can identify malware using the [Malware Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-malware?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json) solution in Log Analytics 
     - you can monitor your networks using the [Azure Application Gateway Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json#azure-application-gateway-analytics-solution-in-log-analytics) solution in Log Analytics or by using [Network Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/network-monitoring-overview)
          
- [OMS Security and Audit Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard) - is a feature that enables IT to actively monitor all resources, which can help minimize the impact of security incidents. OMS Security and Audit has security domains that can be used for monitoring resources. The [Security and Audit Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard) is the home screen for everything related to security in OMS. It provides high-level insight into the security state of your computers. It also includes the ability to view all events from the past 24 hours, 7 days, or any other custom time frame.
