# Monitoring and Alerting

We often think of monitoring as watching and waiting for an event to occur so that we can react to the situation. Security monitoring refers to having a proactive strategy that audits your resources to identify systems that do not meet organizational standards or best practices.

With Azure, there are security tools/features that are available to you to aid you in monitoring, auditing, logging and alerting of any issues to your resources that host your systems. The tool/features available to you are:

 -  [OMS Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json): is a feature under the Operation Management Suite (OMS) that gives you the ability to obtain detailed insights into the activities happening in your Azure environment. With log analytics you can:
     - see operational activities aggregated by status 
     - view trends of activities happening on each of your Azure services 
     - report on authorization changes on all your Azure resources 
     - identify outages or service health issues impacting your resources 
     - use its [query language](https://docs.loganalytics.io/index) to quickly retrieve, consolidate, analyze and create [security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts) from collected data from Azure resources across multiple subscriptions. 
     - you can identify malware using the [Malware Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-malware?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json) solution in Log Analytics 
     - you can monitor your networks using the [Azure Application Gateway Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json#azure-application-gateway-analytics-solution-in-log-analytics) solution in Log Analytics 
     - you can monitor your network security group by using the [Azure Network Security Group Analytics](Azure Network Security Group analytics solution in Log Analytics) solution in Log Analytics
          
- [OMS Security and Audit Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard): is a feature that enables IT to actively monitor all resources, which can help minimize the impact of security incidents. OMS Security and Audit has security domains that can be used for monitoring resources. The [Security and Audit Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-security-getting-started#oms-security-and-audit-dashboard) is the home screen for everything related to security in OMS. It provides high-level insight into the security state of your computers. It also includes the ability to view all events from the past 24 hours, 7 days, or any other custom time frame.

- [OMS Network Performance Monitor (NPM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor): is a suite of capabilities, each of which is geared towards monitoring the health of your network, network connectivity to your applications, and provides insights into the performance of your network. Monitoring capabilities include: [Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-performance-monitor), [ExpressRoute Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-expressroute) and [Service Endpoint Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-network-performance-monitor-service-endpoint). NPM is cloud-based and provides a hybrid network monitoring solution that monitors connectivity between:
     - Cloud deployments and on-premises locations
     - Multiple data centers and branch offices
     - Mission critical multi-tier applications/micro-services
     - User locations and web-based applications (HTTP/HTTPs)

## Preparation 

Perform the following prior to using the procedure in this section:   

  - Ensure you have an Azure subscription and an Office 365 subscription  
  - Ensure that you are the subscription owner of both Azure and Office 365   
  

## Procedure 

### To Configure OMS Azure Log Analytics:   

1. Create a OMS Workspace  
   - Create an OMS workspace so you can add your Log Analytics Solution, see: [Create an OMS Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace).  

 2. Add the Azure Log Analytics Solution  
   - Use the following link to add the Azure Log Analytics Solution to your workspace, see: [Add the Azure log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions) solution.

3. Configure OMS Workspace for Log Analytics  
   - See: [Configuring your OMS Workspace for Azure Log Analytics](/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.3.1-Configuring-OMS-Workspace-for-Azure-Log-Analytics.md)  

4. Create Alerts with Log Analytics   

   - Create alerts based on specific performance metrics or when certain events are created, absence of an event, or a number of events are created within a particular time window.  For further information, see: [Create alerts with log analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-tutorial-response#create-alerts) and use the [Top 10 Queries for Azure Active Directory](/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.3.2-Top-10-Queries-For-Azure-Active-Directory.md) and [Top 5 Azure Networking Operations](/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.3.3-Top-5-Alerts-for-Azure-Networking-Operations.md) as a baseline when creating your alerts.

5. Create Alert Actions with Log Analytics   

   - Create e-mail notifications, launch an Automation Runbook, create incident records in response when alert criteria is met.  For further information, see: [Create alert actions with log analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-tutorial-response#alert-actions).
