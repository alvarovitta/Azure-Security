# Designing your Conditional Access Policies
Use the information described in this section to help you to design and implement conditional access policies.

To master the balance between security and productivity, you also need to factor how a resource is accessed into an access control decision. With Azure AD conditional access, you can address this requirement. Conditional access is a capability of Azure Active Directory that allows you to implement automated access control decisions for accessing your cloud apps that are based on conditions.

Azure AD conditional access provides you with the added security when needed and stays out of your user’s way when it isn’t. As your organization's business, security and compliance requirements evolve, so will your conditional access policies. 

Conditional access helps to resolve potential security risks. Listed below are three, most common access concerns: 

1. [Sign-in risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#sign-in-risk):  Azure AD Identity Protection detects sign-in risks.  

  - How do you restrict access if a detected sign-in risk indicates a bad actor?  

  - How do you obtain stronger evidence that a sign-in was performed by the legitimate user or your doubts are strong enough to even block specific users from accessing an application? 

2. [Network location](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations):  Azure AD is accessible from anywhere. 

  - What if an access attempt is performed from a network location that is not under the control of your IT department? Using a username and password combination may be adequate proof of identity for access attempts to your resources from your corporate network.  

  - What if you demand a stronger proof of identity for access attempts that are initiated from other unexpected countries or regions of the world? What if you want to block access attempts from certain locations?  

3. [Device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#device-platforms):  In Azure AD, users can access cloud apps from a broad range of devices including mobile and also personal devices.  

  - What if you demand that access attempts should only be performed using devices that are managed by your IT department?  

  - What if you even want to block certain device types from accessing cloud apps in your environment?  

 

 

 

## Guidance  
Use the following as guidelines when implementing conditional access: 
 

- Obtain an Azure AD Premium license. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Comparing generally available features of the Free, Basic, and Premium editions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). 

- Review the list of applications that work with conditional access policies, see: [Applications and browsers that use conditional access rules in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference). 

- Review policy requirements. Review: [Conditional Access > Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know)  

- Review assignment trigger conditions: [Conditional Access > How are assignments evaluated?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know) 

- Review conditional access policy functionality:  [Conditional Access Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal#conditional-access-policies). 

- As a first step, evaluate your policy using the:  [What-if Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-whatif). This tool gives you the ability to evaluate the effect of a policy on your environment before you deploy the policy. 

- When you are ready to deploy a new policy into your environment, perform the following in phases: 

  - Apply a policy to a small set of users and verify it behaves as expected.  

  - When you expand a policy to include more users, continue to exclude all administrators from the policy. This ensures that administrators still have access and can update a policy if a change is required. 

  - Apply a policy to all users only if absolutely required.  

- As a best practice, create a user account that is: 

  - Dedicated to policy administration  

  - Excluded from all your policies 

- To avoid undesirable results, review each configuration policy before deploying to your environment: [Best Practices > What you should avoid doing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-avoid-doing)
