# Designing your Conditional Access Policies
Use the information described in this section to help you to design and implement conditional access policies.

**Conditional access is an Azure AD capability that allows you to automate and control access to your end users to their respective cloud applications. With Azure AD conditional access, you have the ability to add that extra layer of security to only allow access to users on certain conditions.**

Conditional access is an Azure AD capability that enables automated, controlled access by users and groups to your cloud applications. Use Azure AD conditional access to add a layer of security when, and as needed. Application access is granted to users only under certain conditions. 

As your organization's business, security and compliance requirements evolve, so will your conditional access policies. For more information on Azure AD conditional access, see: [Conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions).

Conditional access helps to resolve potential security risks. Listed below are three, common points of concern: 

1. [Sign-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#sign-in-risk):  
 Azure AD identity protection detects sign-in risks.  

   - How do you restrict access if a detected sign-in indicates a bad actor?  

   - How do you obtain solid evidence to confirm sign-in by an authorized user and grant access
   
   - How do you obtain solid evidence to confirm sign-in by an unauthorized user and block access to applications? 

2. [Network location](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations):  
  Azure AD is accessible from anywhere. 

   - What if an access attempt is performed from a network location that is not under the control of your IT department? Using a username and password combination may be adequate proof of identity for access attempts to your resources from your corporate network.  

   - What if you require stronger proof of identity for access attempts that are initiated from other unexpected countries or regions of the world? What if you want to block access attempts from certain locations?  

3. [Device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#device-platforms):  
  In Azure AD, users can access cloud apps from a broad range of devices including mobile and also personal devices.  

   - What if you require access attempts to be performed only using devices that are managed by your IT department?  

   - What if you even want to block certain device types from accessing cloud applications in your environment?

## Guidance  
Use the following information to help you design and implement conditional access: 

- Obtain an Azure AD Premium license. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Comparing generally available features of the Free, Basic, and Premium editions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). 

- Review the list of applications that work with conditional access policies, see: [Applications and browsers that use conditional access rules in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference). 

- Review policy requirements. Review: [Conditional Access > Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know)  

- Review assignment trigger conditions: [Conditional Access > How are assignments evaluated?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know) 

- Review conditional access policy functionality:  [Conditional Access Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal#conditional-access-policies). 

- Evaluate your policy using the:  [What-if Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-whatif). This tool gives you the ability to evaluate the effect of a policy on your environment before you deploy the policy. 

- When you are ready to deploy a new policy into your environment, perform the following in phases: 

  - Apply a policy to a small set of users and verify it behaves as expected.  

  - When you expand a policy to include more users, continue to exclude all administrators from the policy. This ensures that administrators still have access and can update a policy if a change is required. 

  - Apply a policy to all users only if absolutely required.  

- As a best practice, create a user account that is: 

  - Dedicated to policy administration  

  - Excluded from all your policies 

- To avoid undesirable results, review each configuration policy before deploying to your environment: [Best Practices > What you should avoid doing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-avoid-doing)
